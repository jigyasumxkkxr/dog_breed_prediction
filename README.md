# dog_breed_prediction
This repository contains a deep learning model built with Keras for predicting dog breeds from a dataset of 10,222 images spanning 120 different breeds. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the softmax activation function, the model achieves accurate classification by learning intricate breed-specific features.
